## Arrays & Hashing

### Arrays

Array is a linear data structure that is a collection of similar data types. It is a static data structure with a fixed size. Each element is accessed using an index. Arrays provide a simple and efficient way to organize and manipulate data.

#### When to Use Arrays

- **Ordered Data:** Arrays are suitable for storing ordered data where the position of each element matters.
- **Random Access:** Accessing elements by index allows for constant-time random access.
- **Fixed Size:** When the size of the collection is known and doesn't change frequently, arrays are a good choice.

#### Advantages

1. **Constant Time Access:** Accessing elements by index is done in constant time, O(1).
2. **Memory Efficiency:** Arrays use contiguous memory, reducing memory overhead.
3. **Simple and Intuitive:** The concept of arrays is straightforward and widely understood.

#### Disadvantages

1. **Fixed Size:** Arrays have a fixed size, making it challenging to dynamically resize them.
2. **Insertion and Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle requires shifting elements, leading to a time-consuming operation.
3. **Homogeneous Elements:** Arrays store elements of the same type, which might limit flexibility.

### Hashing

Hashing is a technique that maps data to a fixed-size array, providing efficient data retrieval. It involves using a hash function to compute an index into an array where the desired data can be found.

#### When to Use Hashing

- **Fast Retrieval:** When you need fast data retrieval based on a key.
- **Avoiding Collisions:** Hashing is useful when effective collision resolution mechanisms are implemented.

#### Advantages

1. **Fast Retrieval:** Hashing provides constant-time average-case complexity for data retrieval.
2. **Dynamic Sizing:** Hash tables can dynamically resize to accommodate varying amounts of data.

#### Disadvantages

1. **Collision Handling:** Collisions may occur, and effective strategies (like chaining or open addressing) are needed to handle them.
2. **Deterministic Output:** Hash functions provide deterministic output, which can lead to clustering of keys.
